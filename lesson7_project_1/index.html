            <h2><em>How Music Can Help</em></h2>
            <p>Stress. It is so common in today's society with young and old people alike. It does not just affect those in school but also those in the workplace. With all this stress in the world, what can help people who are suffering? </p>
            <p>For years, researchers, such as doctors and psychologists,  have looked for solutions to helping reduce stress among people. Some found that yoga was the way to go. Others said that it was taking long, quiet walks. Each person is different and so is their stress. What works for one person may not work for another. This is why there are now so many different ways to reduce stress.</p>
            <p>Music was a common technique that was found effective in many different research studies. It showed that listening to calming music helped works be able to perform better. Listening to music as a way to calm down after a stressful day can relax a person to the point that they can even forget about their stress for a moment. Driving home and listening to music is a great way to destress after work or school.</p>
            <p> All it takes is finding the right song or the right playlist can make a difference. That is why websites such as Spotify and Pandora have stations made specificly for relaxation and destressing. The amount of people who use these stations monthly is in the thousands. If that many people use them, it must work!</p>
