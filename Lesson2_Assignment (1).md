(Please include the URLs in your response.)

One of my favorite websites is the Apple website, https://www.apple.com/, and the other website would be the Spotify website, https://www.spotify.com/us/. They are both similar in the way layout of the websites in general. On the Apple website, at the top of the screen, there is a tab bar that allows an easy access to users to look at all the products and other features available to them. This is done in a similar way on the Spotify website. This tab bar is on the top right of the screen instead of going across the whole top such as on the Apple website. The colors on both website differ. On the Apple website, the top of the page is black and as you scroll down the color changes to white. With the Spotify website, it is full of vibrant colors. It is not just the colors of the album covers listed on the bottom of the page that are brights, but it is the actual background colors. On the Apple website, the only two background colors are black and white. The use of other colors comes from what is featured on the screens of some of the products. I enjoy the layout of both of the websites and how they are similar yet different. Both are able to keep my attention viusually and are easy to use.

## Question #2:  Comparing Website Features and Content
Briefly discuss the five critical web development issues mentioned in your textbook: 
1. Users and Usability
2. Cross-browser compatibility
3. User accessiblity 
4. Search engine optimization
5. Responsive Web Design (RWD)

*ENTER YOUR RESPONSE AFTER THIS STATEMENT:*

1. Users are just trying to use the internet as quickly as possible at times. They want to find and get information which they are looking for as fast as possible and most of the time as easy as possible. By clicking on other links and such they are able to find what they need, and if not, the back button will be their friend.
2. In order to see if web pages are okay to use on other browsers, try testing them on new and old versions of different browers that are commonly used. HTML5 and CSS3 work in modern browsers but sometimes you will have to use workarounds so they still work in older browser versions.
3. While millions of people around the world use the internet, many of them are not aware of accessibility laws that are in place. Some of those being The Americans with Disabilities Act, Sections 504 and 508 of the federal Rehablilitaion Act, and Section 255 of the Telecommunitcations Act of 1996. These are put in place to help and limit the accessiblity of users.
4. In order for a search engine to be easy to use, it needs to clearly state where the link will take the user. A clear content of a link should be text which will show users where it will lead them.
5. RWD is helpful because it helps websites to adjust to different screen sizes of different computers and ever phones. Everything will look the same even though it could be on a smaller screen. Flexible layouts are needed for RWD to work.

## Question #3:
1.  Select THREE topics which were discussed in Lesson 2 that you found interesting.
2.  In 200 words or more, explain each topic in your own words.  Explain how the topic interest you.  (Any topic mentioned in Lesson 2 reading assignment or videos are permissible.)

One of the topics that interested me was the code for a page. I had no idea about the HTML of a page and how all of it worked together to make up the page. All the different lines represent something different on the page. More goes into the source code of a page than I originally thought. I thought it was cool how you easy it was to change parts of a code and also add pictures and or videos as well. I thought that it would have been more complicated than it actually was. All it takes is just adding a link element and the document that you want to add. I enjoyed learning about how you can create the different paragraphs and position of them just by a few simple steps. Adding and editing images seems fun but also a little complicated due to having to fit it perfectly with the text on the page. Changing the color of titles and the font of them is also easier than I thought. All you have to know is the different color names or number combination and the position that you want it to be. Moving paragraphs and titles can be done in two different ways which is helpful to people who want to test out different positions quickly.

Another topic that I found interesting was all the different parts of an URL. As someone who uses the internet on the daily, for both school and personal reasons, I never gave much thought the URL of any website which I was using. In my mind, it is just a URL. I never thought about all the different components and parts to it. I always knew that if you did not put the "http://" of a website it would automatically insert it to the beginning of the URL. I did not know, however, it was called the protocol. I had no idea the different names for the different parts. I just thought that it was all one thing. The domain name is the part that has the www. and the .com/.net/.org in it. Then there is the path which is what comes after the first slash, "/". There can be more than one path depending on how many different pages of the website you go to. Finally, there is the file name. The file name can be omitted, and if it is, the default name of the document for the web server will be used instead. I still find this very interesting that something so simple as a URL is actually not as simple as it may look. 

The last topic that I found interesting was the different ways of sending information through the internet. I knew about bits and bytes and what they are,but I had no idea about the different ways to send them from one place to another. I just thought that it was all done by satellites or something. I never even thought about using other ways to send the information. Electricity was pretty simple, and I am surprised that I did not think about it. It makes since that it would be the cheaper option of the three and I can also see why a signal loss would be a problem with it. Light, however, would never have crossed my mind to be a way to send information. It was interesting to learn about the different wires that you would need to send information this way. Radio being the third option does seem pretty obvious as well which is why I feel slightly dumb for not thinking about it. There are radios is every car and also in most buildings now a days. So, it seems like it is a good way to share information. It does, however, have the draw back of it being short range. All in all, I really liked learning about the different ways of sending information.
